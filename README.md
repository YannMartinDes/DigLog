[Diglog](https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Albert.Cohen/teach/archi/diglog.html) is a software for implementing logic circuits.  

This repo contains logic circuit files such as registers, binary adders, demultiplexers, registers, etc.  
More complex circuits are present, such as the counter

Some files require other files in the directory to work properly.
